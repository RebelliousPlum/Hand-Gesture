# Hand-Gesture

This was a project for my robotics class.
This program uses a webcam or camera to create a box that detects a hand by creating a convex hull around the hand. After defining the convex hull of the hand and using the defects to determine the gesture based on the number of convex defects shown and area ranges.

This program currently only shows the gestures: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'ok', and 'Goodluck'

Issues related to the program:
This program has a hard time defining what is a hand within the region of interest when the lightning is poor or if there are any shapes within the background within specific lighting. 

This program was based on various other programs and other similar projects.
